  <h2 class='c003'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>In presenting the following subject to the consideration
of whom it may concern, I would here state that the two
leading motives which have actuated and guided me through
this absorbing subject has been&mdash;first, the truth of God to
encourage and strengthen the true-believer. Second, to
correct, or "rebuke" the spiritual views, (may I not say
of almost all Christendom,) in respect to the appearing and
kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Twenty-one
years observation and experience, but more especially
the last seven, in pursuit of this object, has taught me that
truth is the only thing that can save the soul. But the great
mass of the professed Christian world seem to pay no more
regard to it than their great <i>Predecessor</i>, who said unto the
Saviour "what is truth?" when he had just said to him that
he "came into the world to bear witness unto the truth, and
every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice." Jesus in
his last prayer for his disciples asks the Father to sanctify
them through the truth. "Thy word is truth." <i>St. John.</i>
Again, he saith. "The Spirit is truth." The forerunner of
Christ said, "The law was given by Moses, but grace and
truth came by Jesus Christ." Jesus says, "I am not come
to destroy the law or the prophets; but to fulfil, for verily
I say unto you till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one
tittle shall in no wise pass from the law until all be fulfilled."
<i>Matthew.</i> Then of course man is required to believe "and
live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
God." Third, thousands who have been looking for the
personal appearing of the Lord Jesus from heaven in these
last days, have in their disappointment about his coming,
given up the only Scriptural view, and are now teaching
that he has come in spirit and this is all we shall ever see
of him here. One single passage from the Saviour's last
words, when about to leave the world in the flesh, ought to
have rectified any such mistake: "And lo, I am with you
always, even unto the end of the world," meaning of course,
his spirit. But I submit the subject.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>THE OPENING HEAVENS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>"<i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, hereafter ye shall see</i> <span class='sc'>Heaven
open</span>, <i>and the angels of God ascending and descending
upon the son of man</i>."&mdash;John i: 51.</p>

<p class='c004'>Notwithstanding my incompetency to do justice to this
momentous subject, I feel constrained to throw out my
views in this public manner, for the benefit of all who feel
an interest in the second coming of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ, to set up, and establish his "everlasting kingdom,"
upon this renovated earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>I believe, according to the testimony of the "two men
seen in white apparel," that "this same Jesus which was
taken up <i>into</i> Heaven will in like manner come again,"
(Acts i: 11) from the same place, and stand in the same
place he left. (See Zach. xiv: 4.) I believe he is in the
third Heaven, in Paradise, with God, the Father; (see 2
Cor. xii: 2, 4; Rev. iii: 21; Heb. i: 3, 9 and 24) that
he is now about to come with the Holy CITY, THE
CAPITAL of his everlasting kingdom, and locate it in the
"midst" of the promised land where he was crucified.
According to this view then there is but one place in the
heavens for this CITY to come from. A spiritual exposition
of these glorious things, now about to be realized,
beclouds the whole, and leaves no tangible ground for
God's people to stand on. Whoever attempts this wilfully
will run the risk of losing his soul, for Jesus says "if any
man shall add or take away from the words of the book of
this prophecy, God shall take away his part (from the tree
<a id='Page_4'></a>of life&mdash;margin) and out of the Holy CITY." Rev. xxii:
19. Proof positive, that the Saints have a part in the City,
and not in themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us now listen to his description of this glorious view
he sees before him, while he sits, pen in hand, all ready to
write down what transpires at the command of his guide.</p>

<p class='c005'>"I, John, saw the holy CITY NEW JERUSALEM
coming down from God, <i>out of Heaven</i>, prepared as a
bride adorned for her husband." In the 5th v. John saw
him that "was dead and is alive forevermore," seated
upon "his throne;" and he said unto me "write, for these
words are true and faithful." "And there came unto me
one of the seven angels, saying come up hither, I will
show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife; and he carried me
away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and <i>shewed</i>
me that great CITY THE HOLY JERUSALEM, descending
<i>out of Heaven</i> from God, having the glory of
God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious,
even like a Jasper stone, clear as crystal. And I heard a
great voice <i>out</i> of Heaven saying, behold, the TABERNACLE
of God is with men." What a beautiful description
is here&mdash;please read the whole chapter. In the two
first verses of the xxii. chapter, we learn that the walls of
this CITY enclose "the tree of life," "which is in the
midst of the <i>Paradise of God</i>." Moses testifies that "the
Lord God planted a <i>garden</i> eastward in <i>Eden</i>, and there
he put the man whom he had formed. And the tree of
life also in the midst of the <i>garden</i>, and a <i>river</i> went out of
<i>Eden</i> to water the garden, and became into four heads."
Gen. xi: 8, 10; iii: 3, 17, 22, 24. Compare this with
Ezekiel's prophecy, xlvii: 3, 5, 12; also xlviii: 30, 35.
There he speaks of waters first shallow and then deep;
waters to swim in that could not be passed over, on the
"banks of which shall be fruit every month, and the leaves
for medicine." He also shows the four sides or "heads"
to the river. The prophet Isaiah says "Look upon <i>Zion,
the City</i>. <i>Jerusalem.</i> <i>Tabernacle</i>, a place of broad rivers and
streams; where shall pass no galley with oars, neither shall
gallant ship pass thereby,"&mdash;xxxiii: 20, 21. Surely this is
the same which Moses and Ezekiel has described; and
John says, "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of
the tree of life, which is in the midst of the <i>Paradise</i> of
God. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life
freely." Rev. xxii: 17, 2, 7. Then this "<i>Holy City</i>, <i>new
<a id='Page_5'></a>Jerusalem</i>, <i>the Zion of God</i>, <i>the Tabernacle of God</i>, <i>the
Bride the Lamb's Wife</i>, <i>the Mother of us all</i>," is a <i>City</i>, enclosed
with a wall one hundred and forty-four cubits high,
which embraces the "<i>garden of Eden, the Paradise of
God</i>." And God calls it his "SANCTUARY." I suppose
that it will be conceded by all, that the <i>Garden of
Eden</i> at the time of the fall, was a literal place, and was
planted eastward. Yes, says one, and it is located in
"Ethiopia or Assyria." How then is it, that the traveller
and historian are entirely silent about it? Surely, it is a
most remarkable place. Hear Moses's description of it:&mdash;"Therefore
the Lord God sent him (Adam) forth from the
garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was
taken. So he drove out the man: and placed at the <i>East</i>
of the garden of Eden, Cherubims and a flaming sword
which turned every way, to guard the tree of life." Gen.
iii: 23, 24. Now we have no account that these Cherubims
and flaming sword has ever been seen within the orbit
of this planet (which is allowed to be 162 millions of
miles in diameter) since the fall of man, but has been far
removed out of their sight. The prophet says, "Behold
the time shall come that these tokens which I have told
thee, shall come to pass, and the <i>Bride</i> shall appear, and
the coming forth shall be seen that <i>now is withdrawn from
the earth</i>,"&mdash;xi. Esdras: 7, 26. This shows that Paradise
is not located in this planet. But perhaps you do not believe
that Esdras is a true prophet; well then, will you believe
St. Paul? He says, "I knew a man in Christ above
fourteen years ago (whether in the body I cannot tell, God
knoweth) such an one caught up to the third Heaven&mdash;God
knoweth how that he was caught up into Paradise
and heard unspeakable words which it is not (possible:
margin) for a man to utter." 2 Cor. xii: 4. St. John's
testimony agrees with Paul, for he says he "saw the <i>Bride
the Lamb's wife</i>, coming down from God, <i>out of Heaven</i>,"
without doubt, the same place where he had been. But
says the objector, if John saw it coming down 1750 years
ago, it ought to have been here by this time. Very true;
but John "saw things which must shortly come to pass."
Rev. 1. Let us just look at a few of the things he saw,
and remember at the same time how he was directed to
write them down, that every important point might be recorded.
He saw the "abomination (Popery) that maketh
desolate set up," four hundred and forty-five years in the
<a id='Page_6'></a>future. Again, he saw the seven angels going forth with
their trumpets to sound&mdash;he particularly describes the three
last. See Rev. viii: 13; ix: 17, 19. Here he shows us
what was to be the component parts of gunpowder, and
in a very peculiar and clear manner describes the musket
with the ball, (head) how they killed men 1350 years before
muskets were used on horse-back&mdash;17th v. Further,
how could he have described the second advent history so
minutely as he has done in the xiv. chapter, if he had not
have seen what was to be, and has been fulfilled; and how
is it possible he could have given such a lamentable picture
of "Mistery Babylon," if he had not have seen in <i>these
last days</i> of "perilous times," the professed children of
God drinking from the old mother's cup of poison, while
"she was drunk with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus."
Rev. xvii. and xviii. Once more, how did David see that
blood thirsty mob shoot out the lip, and laugh to scorn
their Savior; and the four Roman soldiers under his cross
dividing his garments and casting lots for his vesture, twelve
hundred years before it took place. John xix: 23, 24.
Why! just as St. John saw the <i>Holy City</i> coming down at
the second advent of Jesus&mdash;just as I believe, it will be
seen, "Having the glory of God: and her light was like
unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear
as crystal." Rev. xxi: 11. The most precious is the
green, spotted with red and purple. We will now look
at the</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>ASTRONOMICAL VIEW.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>From what part of Heaven will this glorious <i>City</i> appear?
We answer, from where the flaming sword is
"guarding the way of the tree of life," and the Cherubims
are stationed. John i: 51. Furgerson, the celebrated
astronomer of the last century, in describing some of the
many wonders in the Heavens, says "that the two bright
clouds in the heavens at the south pole, called by mariners
the clouds of Magelen, are by astronomers called cloudy
stars, but the most remarkable of all the cloudy stars is
that in the middle of Orion's Sword, where seven stars
(of which three are very close together) seem to shine
through a cloud, very lucid in the middle, but faint and ill
defined about the edges. It looks like a <span class='fss'>GAP</span> in the sky,
through which one may see (as it were) part of a much
brighter region. Although most of the spaces are but a
<a id='Page_7'></a>few minutes of a degree in breadth, yet, since they are
among the fixed stars, they must be spaces larger than
what is occupied by our Solar System&mdash;(the Solar System
includes the Planet Uranus, which is one thousand and
eight hundred millions of miles from the Sun, the circumference
of her orbit in which she revolves around the Sun
is calculated to be three hundred and fourteen millions of
miles)&mdash;and in which there seems to be a perpetual uninterrupted
day among numberless worlds, which no human
art can ever discover."&mdash;<i>Furgerson's Treatise on Astronomy,
edition A. D. 1770.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>Out of ninety-three, Orion is the most striking and splendid
constellation in the Heavens; her centre is mid way
between the poles of heaven and directly over the equator
of the Earth, and is visible from all the habitable parts of
the Globe. On her south-eastern quarter is the beautiful
star Sirius, (one of the most magnificent in the Heavens.)
and on the north-west is stationed the Pleiades or seven
Stars. "She rises at noon about the 9th of March" "and
sets at noon about the 21st of June," and comes to the
meridian January 23d, at 9 P. M. She is now to be seen
for a little while, in the evening twilight, about one hour
high, with the Planets Jupiter and Mars on her north and
north-west. When the Lord answered Job out of the
whirl wind, and demanded of him to answer to the wonderful
questions which he was now about to put to him,
he says "Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades
<i>or loose the bands of</i> <span class='sc'>Orion</span>." When Amos, the
Prophet exhorted his Israel to repentance, he endeavored
to impress their minds with the power of God by adverting
to the wonderful phenomena in the Heavens, by saying,
"Seek him that maketh the Seven Stars and Orion,"
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Huggens</span>, its first discoverer, gives the following description
of it: "Astronomers place three stars close
together in the Sword of Orion; and when I viewed the
middle-most with a Telescope, in the year 1656, there appeared
in the place of that one, twelve other stars; among
these three that almost touch each other, and four more
besides appeared twinkling as through a cloud, so that the
space about them seemed much brighter than the rest of
the heaven, which appearing wholly blackish, by reason
of the fair weather, was seen as through a curtain opening,
through which one had a free view into another region
<a id='Page_8'></a>which was more enlightened. I have frequently observed
the same appearance in the same place without any alteration;
so that it is likely that this wonder, whatever it may
be in itself, has been there from all times; but I never
took notice of any thing like it among the rest of the fixed
stars."</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir <span class='sc'>William Herschel</span> says, "If stars of the eighth
magnitude are to be considered at an average of eight
times further distant than those of the first, then this nebula
cannot be supposed to be less than 320,000,000,000,000,
three hundred and twenty thousand billions of miles from the
earth. If its diameter at this distance subtend an angle of ten
minutes, which it nearly does, its magnitude must be utterly
inconceivable. It has been calculated that it must
exceed 2,000,000,000,000,000,000, or two trillions of times
the dimensions of the Sun, vast and incomprehensible as
these dimensions are."&mdash;<i>See Dick's Siderial Heavens, Vol.
VIII. pp. 181, 184.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>Says this author&mdash;"Suffice it to say that such an enormous
mass of luminous matter was not created in vain,
but serves a purpose in the divine arrangements corresponding
to its magnitude and the nature of its luminosity,
and to the wisdom and intelligence of him whose power
brought it into existence. It doubtless subserves some
important purpose, even at the present moment, to worlds
and beings within the range of its influence. But the
ultimate in all its bearings and relations, may perhaps remain
to be evolved during the future ages of an interminable
existence." Page 184.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again, says the <span class='sc'>Illustrated London News</span> of April
19th, 1845: "Marvellous rumors are afloat respecting the
Astronomical discoveries made by Lord Rosse's monster
Telescope. (This is said to be sixty feet long and its great
speculum or reflecting large glass measures six feet in
diameter and weighs three and three-fourths tons, and is
calculated to discover glorious objects in the Heavens, to
man heretofore unknown.) It is stated that Regulus, instead
of being a sphere, is ascertained to be a Disc; and
stranger still, that the nebula in the belt of Orion (meaning
the bright place before stated) is a universal system, a sun
with planets moving round it, as the earth and her fellows
move around our glorious luminary."</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus we see from all the testimony adduced, (and we
could give much more were it necessary) that here is a
<a id='Page_9'></a>most wonderful and inexplainable phenomena in the heavens:
a gap in the sky, more than 11,314,000,000 miles in
circumference. Says the celebrated <span class='sc'>Huggens</span>, "I never
saw anything like it among the rest of the fixed stars&mdash;a
free view into another region more enlightened." I have
had the pleasure (with others) during the past month, to
see this wonder in the Heavens a number of evenings,
through J. Delano, Jr's. excellent Telescope.</p>

<p class='c005'>It has been supposed by some, that this wonderful phenomena
seen through the sword of Orion, has passed
through some material change since it was first discovered
by Huggens, one hundred and ninety years ago. On this
point Sir John Herschel says: "When it is considered
how difficult it is to represent such an object duly, and
how entirely its appearance will differ even in the same
Telescope, according to the clearness of the air, or other
temporary causes, we shall readily admit that we have no
<i>evidence of change</i> that can be relied on."</p>

<p class='c005'>As I had before partially examined the Bible view of the
<i>opening Heavens</i>, I think I never shall forget the thrill that
pervaded my whole being, the first time that I saw this celestial
wonder coursing its way down the western Heavens!
Since then, when I have viewed it through the
Telescope, my mind would instinctively revert to Moses's
description of the <i>liberated</i> children of Abraham, passing
through the Red Sea, with that wonderful miracle "the
pillar of fire, between them and the Egyptian Host." My
thoughts still running onward, from type to antitype,
"God looking through the cloud of fire in the morning
watch;" at once vanquished the enemies of his chosen
people. Exo. xiv: 24, 27.</p>

<p class='c005'>So in <i>this</i> morning watch God will not only look through
this mighty space, (black on one side with the stormy
cloud,) but, as the Prophet Joel says, he will "<i>Roar out of
Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the Heavens
and the Earth shall shake: but the Lord will be the hope of
his people.&mdash;So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God
dwelling in Zion my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be
holy.</i>" ("<span class='fss'>CLEANSED.</span>") iii: 16, 17.</p>

<p class='c005'>A western view, with an inverting eye piece, gives it
the appearance of a stormy dark cloud, with a full moon
just shut in behind it, and three bright stars looking
through the cloud. This dark looking cloud is called the
gap in the sky. This constellation measures about one
<a id='Page_10'></a>thousand miles from North to South, and five hundred
from East to West, and is visible to all the inhabitants of
the earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here then is a mighty Image (as represented on the
map of the Heavens,) stretched across mid heaven, with
his gold and silver epaulettes (four hundred and eighty
miles apart) and two burning stars denoting his Northern
and Southern extremities: the golden one on his upraised
left foot, the other of silver on his right knee, answering
to the one on his left shoulder; girded with his brilliant
studded belt and flaming sword; "doubtless, to subserve
some important purpose even at the present moment."
Let it be distinctly understood, with what has already been
stated by the Astronomers, that this "constellation is one
of the most brilliant and noted in the Heavens," that its
nebula, (according to the celebrated Sir <span class='sc'>William Herschel</span>)
far exceeds any other object, and its magnitude
utterly inconceivable, two trillions times larger than the
Sun; while the Sun is allowed to be thirteen hundred
thousand times larger than our globe. That it "never
yet has been resolved into stars by the highest power of
the telescope," and there is no evidence of any change,
even if it were discovered to be resolvable, (as is stated
by a writer somewhat acquainted with Lord Rosse's monster
telescope.) If so, it goes to strengthen the argument
of its first discoverer, who says "through which one had
a free view into another region which was more enlightened."</p>

<p class='c005'>If, then, there is nothing to be seen on Earth or in the
Heavens except what Joshua and David saw, v: 13, 14;
1 Chro. xxi: 15, 16, that looks like this constellation,
would it be thought strange for a Christian to believe that
the Prophet Moses had recorded for our instruction the
very answer to be given, viz. "to keep the way of the
tree of life."</p>

<p class='c005'>I have now given a general description of this celestial
wonder, but some may still doubt whether any thing can
be ascertained with respect to objects so far removed. If
the most accurate calculations had not already been made
in respect to many of the heavenly bodies, how could the
tempest tossed mariner, after being driven for days, and
sometimes weeks, sailing on all points of the compass, and
perhaps, not have known his position from the time he
had taken his departure from his port, only by dead reckoning,
<a id='Page_11'></a>nothing in sight but sea and sky, ascertain his
true position? Just look,&mdash;there stands the captain, on
some convenient part of the deck of his ship, holding in
his hand a three cornered instrument, called a Sextant,
measuring the distance between the sun and moon, or if it
be in the night, between the moon and some lunar star,
(which is millions on millions of miles removed from the
Solar System,) noting the moment by his watch when he
brings the outer or inner edges of these two celestial objects
to touch; then measuring their distance from the
horizon. With the help of a Nautical Almanac, (which
had been published years before,) in the course of twenty
minutes he so confidently ascertains his position, (however
strange it may appear to landsmen,) that he would, after
running ten or one hundred miles more or less, as the
case may be, direct one of his crew to go to the mast head,
and tell him at the same time in what direction to look for
land. Presently the cry would come down, thrilling
through every soul in the ship, "Land ho!" "Where
away?" "Off the starboard bow, sir, where you told me
to look." Such instances are not rare, but of daily occurrence.
"How could that be?" says one, "it looks like a
miracle!" So it would be, if the great God had not directed
these celestial objects to move in perfect harmony.
A place for every one, and every one in its place.</p>

<p class='c005'>One at a certain time said, "Canst thou by searching
find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?"
The wise man answers, "No man can find
out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the
end." Ecl. iii: 2; Job xi: 7. These texts alone teach
us that we yet know but little of the power and wisdom
of the Sovereign of the universe, whose spirit fills unlimited
space; which space is undoubtedly coeval and coextensive
with eternity; studded with millions on millions of
worlds, each moving in its appropriate Sphere, like our own
Planet. But a still greater wonder is the thousands and
millions of blazing Comets, even in the Solar System,
(Dick, vol. viii: p. 339,) seemingly sailing with a roving
commission, sweeping their burning trails all over the
perceptible universe of God, each moving in its proper
Orbit! some of them shooting, at times, almost with the
velocity of lightning! And yet, with what precision does
the Astronomer calculate their appearing again after hundreds
and thousands of years, without interfering with any
<a id='Page_12'></a>of the celestial scenery. Just turn over to the second
page of your Almanac and learn with what admirable
accuracy the Astronomer has calculated, even to a moment
of time, when the moon of yesterday will be passing
under the sun, and cause the darkness to be seen and felt.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some minds may be troubled about the flaming sword
being placed at the East of the Garden, or that we could
see the Eastern side. This will be better understood by
looking at the motion of our Planet. It is said by Astronomers
that this Earth in its annual motion, is booming
round the sun at the rate of nineteen miles per second;
at the same time her diurnal motion from East to West is
at the rate of ten miles per minute: consequently all the
objects we see in the heavens, comes from the East, and
among the rest this glorious constellation of <i>Orion</i>, all just
as natural as it is for us to see the Sun rise in the East;
and in the same direction the world will soon see what the
Second Advent believer has long and anxiously been
waiting for: viz. the "glorious appearing of the great God
and our Saviour Jesus Christ." Titus ii: 13. Now let
us take another view; not through Lord Rosse's, but God's
great Telescope, which "declares the end from the beginning."
Isa. 46: 10.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>BIBLE VIEW.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>The patriarch Jacob said to his sons that "God Almighty
appeared unto him at Luz, which is Bethel." Gen. 48:
3; 25: 26. Here, while a Pilgrim traveller and stranger,
he had laid himself down for the night, he "dreamed, and
behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it
reached to Heaven; and behold, the angels of God ascending
and descending on it." Gen. xxviii: 12. Seventeen
hundred and ninety years after this, the Lord says to
Nathaniel, "hereafter ye shall see <span class='fss'>HEAVEN OPEN</span>, and the
angels of God ascending and descending upon the son of
man." This, then, is in the future. Next in order, Ezekiel
has a vision, in the thirtieth "year of the Babylonish
captivity by the river Chebar." He says, "the Heavens
were <span class='fss'>OPENED</span>, and I saw visions of God." He proceeds
to describe his vision; please read Chap. i: 5, 10; 24,
28. He sees as the appearance of a man&mdash;describes also
the stormy cloud with the brightness round about it; he
also hears a <i>voice</i> from the firmament, and says that the
<a id='Page_13'></a>Lord God spake to him. Now see Chap. x: 4, 5; 19, 20.
Here he says "the Cherubims stood at the door of the
<i>East</i> gate (where Moses says they were placed) of the
Lord's House, and the glory of the God of Israel was over
them above." "This is the living creature that I saw
<i>under</i> the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and <i>I knew
that they were Cherubims</i>." Is it not plain that Ezekiel has
shown the same place and station of the Cherubims which
Moses has, on the East side, keeping the way of the tree
of life. Jacob calls them angels, and cries out in terror,
"How dreadful is this place, this is none other but the
House of God and this is the <i>gate</i> (or opening) of Heaven."
17 v. Isaiah in a vision sees "the throne high and
lifted up, and hears the <i>voice</i> of God," as did the others.
Let us examine here a few moments to see what Cherubims
are, and their use. One writer says, "they appear
to be servants of God sent to do his will." Hear God
concerning them, "and there will I meet with thee and I
will commune with thee from between the two Cherubims
which are upon the Ark of the testimony, of all things
which I will give thee in commandment unto the children
of Israel." Exo. xxv: 16, 22. <span class='sc'>Proof</span>&mdash;"And Hezekiah
(in his distress) prayed before the Lord, and said O Lord
God of Israel which dwelleth between the Cherubims,"
2 Kings, xix: 15. "And God sent the prophets to tell
him that his prayer was heard." v. 20.</p>

<p class='c005'>"The Lord reigneth let the people tremble; he setteth
between the Cherubims, let the earth be moved." Psl. xcix:
1. Then here is where we are to look for the Paradise of
God, the Holy City, and where we shall soon hear the
voice of God, for he "sitteth above between the Cherubims,"
as is represented in the old Tabernacle and Temple.
"For see, saith he, that thou make all things according
to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount." Heb. viii:
5; ix: 5. St. John also describes them, and tells what
their occupations were in heaven. Rev. v: 11, 12.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now we will proceed with the testimony concerning the
opening heavens. John the Baptist bears record, that
when he was coming up out of the water from baptising
the Saviour, he "saw the heavens <span class='fss'>OPENED</span> (or cloven or
rent) and the spirit like a dove descending upon him, and
there came a <i>voice</i> from heaven," &amp;c. Mark i: 10, 11;
Luke iii: 20, 22; Matt. iii: 16, 17; John i: 32.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here is the opening heavens, and the voice of God as
<a id='Page_14'></a>before. When Jesus was transfigured on the Mount the
Disciples saw the cloud and heard the <i>voice</i> of God.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the Savior ascended from Mount Olivet, his disciples
saw him: the two shining ones said, "Ye men of
Galilee why stand ye gazing up <i>into heaven</i>? (it must
have been <i>open</i> to their view, or they could not have looked
<i>into</i> heaven) this same Jesus which is taken up from
you <i>into heaven</i> shall come again in like manner as ye have
seen him go <i>into heaven</i>." Acts i: 11. Then of course,
it will be from the same place.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us not be deceived about this, he has not come yet.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again, St. Luke says of Stephen, the martyr, (while he
was surrounded by a blood-thirsty mob, gnashing on him
with their teeth, because of the burning truths which he uttered,)
"Being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly
<i>into heaven</i>, (at a certain point) and saw the glory of
God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God: and
said, <i>behold, I see the heavens opened</i>, and the son of man
standing on the right hand of God." Was Stephen mistaken?
I think not&mdash;it was his dying testimony.</p>

<p class='c005'>But here is a more singular case still, two miracles on
two individuals of different nations to establish and fulfil
Daniel's prophecy of the seventieth week upon his people
(the Jews). The time had now come and something out
of the ordinary way was to mark this epoch of time. Now
look yonder in Cesarea, there is a Gentile in a vision, he
sees an angel which directs him to send into Judea for a
certain Jew named Peter. Where is he? At a place
called Joppa. (the sea port of Jerusalem,) lying in a trance,
on the top of a house, and made to feel "very hungry," (that
he might more readily and willingly follow the teachings
of the voice and spirit of God to proclaim salvation to the
Gentiles, for he was one of the <i>stubborn ones</i>, that held to
the <i>present truth</i>; and perhaps could not be prevailed upon
to yield in any other way.) Just so with his <i>stubborn</i> brethren,
who called him to an account for going in to the
Gentiles, but after he had rehearsed the whole matter to
them, "then they believed and glorified God, for granting
repentance to the Gentiles." But what was the miracle?
Peter says he "saw <i>heaven opened</i> and a certain vessel descending
unto him as it had been a great sheet knit at
the four corners, and let down to the earth. This was
done thrice (or three times) and the vessel was received
up again <i>into Heaven</i>," and the voice of the Lord came to
<a id='Page_15'></a>him twice, "saying what God has cleansed call not thou
common." Acts x. and xi. ch. Here ends the confirming
of the Covenant with many for one week. Danl. ix: 27,
Heb. ii: 3.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Apostle Paul in relating his vision says that he was
"caught up to the third Heavens <i>into Paradise</i>." 2 Cor.
xii: 2, 4. St. John, the "beloved disciple," in his solitary
confinement on the Isle of Patmos, not only has the same
view of the <i>opening Heavens</i>, and hears the same voice,
but was called up there in the spirit, and immediately he
was there, describing the glories of Heaven. Please read
his description of the glorious picture before and around
the throne, (from whence the Prophets and Apostles already
quoted, have looked through God's <i>all</i> magnifying
Telescope, and was burdened with the cry, "This is none
other but the House of God and this is the <i>gate</i> of Heaven!"
"And lo, the Heavens were <i>opened</i>"!! "I see Heaven
<i>open</i>"!!! At the same time and place God speaks with
them). V: 6&mdash;here he sees the Lamb. Also vii: 15;
viii: 3, 5, and xii: 5. Jesus the Son was caught up there,
xx: 11, and xxi: 5. Same thing in the iv: 8 v. he has
Isaiah's view of the Seraphims and uses nearly the same
language in describing them, and says with Isaiah they rest
neither day nor night, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God
Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come, 8 v., and in
the fifth chapter he says "And I beheld and heard the voices
of many angels round about the throne, saying with a
loud voice, worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive
power," &amp;c. &amp;c. Ezekiel's Cherubims and John's Angels
are undoubtedly the same. John's <i>four</i> beasts, Isaiah's
Seraphims, and Ezekiel's <i>four</i> wheels are typical of the
<i>four</i> grand divisions of the Camp of Israel, around the
Tabernacle in the wilderness, all marshalled and arrayed
by God's direction with their <i>four</i> different standards, (answering
to the <i>four</i> faces or sides to Ezekiel's wheel, and
the faces of John's four beasts). Juda with the Lion in the
front on the East, (Num. ch. ii.) all ready to move at a
moment's warning. Even where the "cloudy pillar by day
or of fire by night;" which rested on the Tabernacle, should
direct. The Levites, the ministers of God, all moving in
perfect harmony, with the Ark containing the Commandments
of God; close after which, in the midst of the camp,
in solid columns follows the taken down tabernacle. All
moving after and watching the direction of this "fiery pillar
<a id='Page_16'></a>by night," and the moment it ceased to move the camp
halted. The Tabernacle was raised, and the Commandments
of God, (the keeping of which will secure an entrance
into the Anti-type, the real Heavenly Tabernacle,
that is to be "with men," Rev. xxi: 3; xxii: 14.) restored
to their proper place <i>beneath</i>, and under the guardian care
of the Cherubims between which his people were directed
to pray unto him. Exo. xxv: 22.</p>

<p class='c005'>John also has described in the above mentioned texts,
much of the furniture particularized in the old Tabernacle,
which Paul says are "patterns of the true." Heb. ix: 23,
24. Conclusive evidence that he was in the "<i>true</i> (or
real) Tabernacle which God pitched, and not man." Heb.
viii: 2. The same <i>City</i>, which Abraham "looked for,
whose builder and maker is God." The Psalmist also
agrees with Paul; and says, "The Lord has <i>prepared his
throne</i> in the Heavens." Paul says, that Jesus is there.
See Heb. viii: 1, 2; and ix: 24. Jesus says, "he that
overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my <i>throne</i>, even
as I also overcame and am set down with my Father in
<i>his throne</i>." Rev. iii: 21. Now, is it not evident that
God has but one sanctuary, and that his throne is there;
and one place for that sanctuary, and that place in the third
heavens? Why then, should there be more than one way
to approach it, or for it to come from, namely, by "the
Cherubims and flaming sword, stationed there, to guard
the way?"</p>

<p class='c005'>The editor of the Day Star asks, "why we stand gazing
up into heaven; can you (meaning, I suppose, any one)
tell where this same Jesus is coming from?" 2d. "Can
you prove God the Father to be in one place, in any greater
degree and power, than he is in any and every, and
every other place?"</p>

<p class='c005'>If we have not already offered sufficient evidence, in
answer to these two most important questions to the true
believer in Christ, we will try a little further; for if we
cannot understand, nor in any way comprehend, the
teachings of the divine word, in respect to the second
coming and kingdom of Jesus Christ, the location of the
heavenly <i>Sanctuary</i>, the new Jerusalem, God's dwelling
place, other than is figuratively discerned, then, I say, we
that truly believe in God, "are of all men the most miserable;"
and the sooner we hoist the <i>Shaker's</i> flag, and bring
too under the lee of their <i>camp</i>, the better; for I should
<a id='Page_17'></a>despair of ever getting my anchor <i>down</i> "within the vale."
In the first place then, we say, Jesus has not yet come the
second time, in the manner he promised us. For when
speaking of his coming, he says emphatically, "Then shall
THEY SEE <i>the Son of man coming in the clouds of Heaven</i>,"
&amp;c. Now, according to this description, I'll venture
the assertion, that there is not a particle of proof in the
universe, that one solitary individual has seen him. Hence,
I for one, am gazing up into heaven looking, and unwaveringly
believing, that this, his precious promise, will
soon be realized. But you say, he has come in his saints.
Well, I say there is no more proof of this, than there was
that he was in his apostle's, eighteen hundred years ago&mdash;for
they certainly wrought many wonderful miracles, and
preached with as much power; and the mighty weapons
they used, was the death, resurrection and second coming
of Christ. Now did the Apostle's ever teach such a doctrine,
that Jesus had come <i>in them</i> the second time? and
further, I cannot believe that he will be seen any sooner
in Ohio, than in New-England or New-York. Again, we
answer to the first and second questions, combined&mdash;Rev.
iv: 2. Here is a throne, with one seated upon it. Is
there any proof to be found that this throne was on the Isle
of Patmos, Rome, or any other city, or place in this globe?
Will it not be conceded by all Bible students, that the Lord
God Almighty, the Father, is seated upon it? Does not
the Seraphims which are continually crying, Holy, Holy,
Holy, in the eighth verse, say so? Who was found worthy
to come and take the book out of the right hand of
him that sat upon this throne? Did he take it out of his
own hand? No, it does not read so. Who, then? John
says, it "was the Lamb." Others said, it "was the Lion
of the tribe of Juda." We say, "the Son of the Father."
Here, then, where the door was <i>opened</i> into heaven, John
saw the Father and the Son together, <i>at one time and in
one place</i>, transacting business; at the sight of which, ten
thousand times ten thousand, and thousands and thousands
of angels cried aloud, "worthy is the Lamb," &amp;c.; and
every creature under heaven acknowledged it! Verse 11,
13. I am aware that it will be said this is symbolical language.
Allow me to quote an extract from a celebrated
writer. "Even the symbolic parts of a vision have a
mixed character. When real persons, the highest in their
kind are mentioned by their proper titles, there is no room
<a id='Page_18'></a>for symbols; the objects represent themselves, God and
Christ and the good angels; Satan and evil spirits, and redeemed
saints on earth or in heaven, are never emblems.
Forsake this maxim, and symbolic prophecy becomes a
chaos, in which nothing is fixed, and where fancy runs riot
in its own excesses."</p>

<p class='c005'>But you say, God is a spirit. (There is no doubt but
what his spirit pervades all space, and every thing in it
that has life.) But to the testimony. "Ye have neither
heard his voice nor seen his shape." John v: 37. Did
Jesus contradict the Patriarchs and Prophets? No, no!
He here told his persecutors what they had not seen nor
heard; he did not say he had no voice or shape. Who
did? 1st. Moses. "And I will cover thee with my <i>hand</i>
while I pass by; and I will take away mine <i>hand</i> and thou
shalt see my <i>back parts</i>, but my <i>face</i> shall not be seen."
Exod. xxxiii: 22, 23. 2d. The "<i>eyes</i> of the Lord are
upon the righteous, and his <i>ears</i> are open unto their cry.
The <i>face</i> of the Lord are against them that do evil: the
Lord <i>heareth</i>." Psalms xxxiv: 15, 17. Again, the "Ancient
of days did <i>sit</i>, whose <i>garment</i> was white as snow,
and the <i>hair of his head</i> like the pure wool." Does not
this prove a shape, features, and voice, ascribed to God,
the same as to man. "And God said let us make man in
our own image, after our likeness; so God created man
in his own image, in the <i>image of God</i> created he him:
male and female created he them." Gen. i: 26, 27. Paul
says of Jesus, "Who is the <i>image of God</i>, (this can't be
spiritually so) the first born of every creature; who being
in the <i>form of God</i>, thought it not robbery to be equal with
God." Eph. ii: 5, 6. Now to the Hebrews&mdash;"Hath in
these last days spoken unto us by his son, who being the
brightness of his glory, and the EXPRESS IMAGE of his
person." Now turn to the history of Rome for a moment&mdash;read
how <span class='sc'>Lentulus</span> describes the Savior to the Roman
Senate. Here he describes his stature, countenance, his
eyes, beautiful flowing hair, his wisdom, &amp;c., and finally
closes with the following: "A <i>man</i> for his singular beauty
far exceeding all the sons of men." Paul says, he is the
"<i>express image</i>" <i>of God</i>. (I understand him to say that
he looks just like him.) Oh, says one, this man is a Unitarian!
So then was Paul, or I have not quoted him right.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Daniel, the prophet, teaches the same doctrine.
"I saw in the night visions: and behold, one like the Son
<a id='Page_19'></a>of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the
Ancient of days, (described in the ninth verse) and they
brought him near before him; and there was given him
dominion and glory, and a kingdom, never to be destroyed."
Dan. vii: 13, 14. Now we all admit this personage
was Jesus Christ; for no being on earth or in heaven, has
ever had the promise of an everlasting kingdom but him.
And does not the Ancient of days give it to him? Would
it not be absurd to say that he gave it to himself? How
then can it be said (or proved) as it is by some, that the
Son is the Ancient of days;&mdash;this passage, and the one in
fifth Revelations, distinctly prove God and his Son to be
two persons in heaven. Jesus says, "I proceeded forth
and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent
me." John viii: 42. "I come forth from the Father,
and am come into the world; again, I leave the world and
go to the Father." (Does he remain in the same place?)
"We are confident I say, and willing rather to be absent
from the body, and present with the Lord." Paul.</p>

<p class='c005'>"The Scripture testimony accounts for no other spirits
but those seen in the shape of men." One of the three
which came to Abraham was the Lord. Gen. xviii. The
Angel Gabriel was called the "man Gabriel." Danl. ix.
The angel which appeared to Gideon was called the Lord.
I think here is sufficient proof from the Scriptures to justify
the true believer to be still looking for a personal
Saviour, and that God the Father is a person, and looks
like Jesus and we like him; and God has a habitation
where he dwells, as the Scriptures testify:</p>

<p class='c005'>"And I John saw the <i>Holy City new Jerusalem</i> coming
down from God out of Heaven."</p>

<p class='c005'>Another writer in the same paper undertakes to prove
that this same City has began to appear; has been developing
itself since the fall of 1844. Who has seen this
City? O, he says, it is evident, that it is the saints. Is it
possible that the Saints have been <i>coming down from Heaven</i>
this eighteen months! Why, there is not the least particle
of proof that the righteous dead have yet been caught up?
Thes. iv: 16, 17. I can readily believe that both of these
brethren have been fearless advocates for the truth, and I
do not doubt their sincerity. They have clearly proved
that they are not seeking the applause of the world. I
sincerely hope that they will not get so far into the fire on
one side of the "highway" as some are in the "slough of
<a id='Page_20'></a>despond" on the other. The main business of the Devil
is now to make God's people change their course, and it is
matter of no moment to him on which side of the "highway"
they fall. In either case he will make sure of his
prey. God help us to be on our watch. The great error
here has arisen in consequence of taking the symbolical
meaning and rejecting the true. The author of the Apocalyptic
Dictionary, <span class='sc'>R. C. Shemeall</span>, says, "<i>Holy City,
Jerusalem.</i> Used symbolically of the present visible Church;
Literally, that <span class='sc'>City</span> which comes down from God." Let
us examine a few texts: "Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem."
Jer. ii: 2. "And he carried away all Jerusalem."
Kings xxiv: 14. "The cry of Jerusalem is gone up." Jer.
xiv: 2. "Jerusalem has sinned they have seen her nakedness,
yea she sigheth." Lam. i: 8. "Jerusalem is a menstrous
woman." 17 v. "Awake, awake, stand up O Jerusalem."
Isa. li: 17. "Arise and set down O Jerusalem."
lii: 2. "O Jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness."
Jer. iv: 14. "Cut off thine hair O Jerusalem and cast it
away." Jer. vi: 8. Here we see that old Jerusalem is
personified. The prophets exhort her to "stand up" and
"set down," and "awake from sleep," and "wash her
heart," and "be instructed," to "cut off her hair and cast
it away." She is also called a "menstrous woman," and
said to "cry and sigh," and be "carried away." A "tumultuous
city;" a "joyous city;" a "glad city." "Thou
art comely, O my love, as Jerusalem." Songs vi: 4.
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest," &amp;c. Now
this language never could be understood, unless there was
1st: a Jerusalem, people and government; neither could
we understand what is said of the new Jerusalem in many
places, without associating organization, as the "Zion of
God," "the Zion of the Holy One of Israel." Isa. lx: 14.
"Like the kingdom of God among the Pharisees." Luke
xvii: 21. This old Jerusalem at his second coming would
be the place for the capital of his kingdom; his disciples the
subjects; he their king. As also in Daniel viii: 13&mdash;connecting
the "Host (God's people) and sanctuary." Paul to
the Galatians says, "Agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and
answereth to Jerusalem, which now is, and is in bondage
with <i>her children</i>. But Jerusalem which is above is free,
which is the <i>mother</i> of us all." Can this testimony be credited?
Did not "Abraham look for a city which had
foundations?" Paul also says of the pilgrims and strangers
<a id='Page_21'></a>on the earth, that they "were seeking an heavenly
country for God <i>hath</i> prepared for them a <i>City</i>"! Heb. xi.
in the past tense; then it cannot be developing now in his
Saints, but they are preparing to enter the <span class='fss'>CITY</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>When John was describing the <i>City</i> in xxi. Rev. he said
he saw no temple there "for the Lord God Almighty and
the Lamb are the Temple of it." Now Peter and Paul
distinctly describe the Saints (not the city) coming to this
Mount Zion, and Temple, which makes it perfect and
complete. Peter says of his "spiritual house," "Ye also
as lively stones, [be ye built&mdash;<i>margin</i>.] up a spiritual
house." 1 Pet. ii: 5. To whom coming as unto a living
stone. 4 v. For, says sixth verse, behold I lay in Zion a
chief corner stone. (Jesus.) Peter says of this Temple, <i>be
ye built</i>. Paul says it is <i>growing</i>. Read how admirably
he describes it to the Ephesians. "Fellow citizens with
the Saints, and of the household of God. And are built
upon the <i>foundation</i> of the Apostles and <i>Prophets</i>," (see
John's twelve gates representing the twelve tribes in Rev.
xxi: 12; and the twelve Apostles of the Lamb representing
the twelve foundations of the wall, 14th verse, which
encloses the whole,) Jesus Christ himself being the chief
corner stone, <i>In whom all the building fitly framed</i> <span class='fss'>GROWETH
INTO</span> <i>an holy Temple in the Lord</i>; In whom ye also are
builded <i>together</i> for an habitation of God. Eph. ii: 19, 22.
His Epistle to the Hebrews shows how they are brought
together and where. "But ye are come unto Mount Zion,
and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
and to an innumerable company of angels; To the
general assembly and church of the first born, which are
(enrolled&mdash;<i>margin</i>) in heaven; And to God the Judge of
all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to
Jesus the Mediator of the new Covenant." Now has not
Paul distinctly described <i>what</i> the Saints <i>shall come to</i>. O
but, say you, we have already come. No, no, friend, you
are too fast. Paul will explain: "<i>Mount Zion</i> the <i>City
the Heavenly Jerusalem</i> to the innumerable company of
Angels (or Cherubims) to the Church of the first born and
to God, and to Jesus." xii: 22, 24. Now where? See
25, 28, when he speaketh from heaven. His voice once
shook the earth, but now he is about to speak and shake
heaven also, wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
cannot be moved, (this is after every thing else is moved,)
therefore wait until God shall speak in the language of Joel,
<a id='Page_22'></a>and "Roar out of Zion and utter his voice from Jerusalem."
Paul shows the Corinthians how it is finished.
Hear him: "What agreement hath the temple of God
with idols? for <i>ye</i> are the <i>Temple</i> of the living God, as God
hath said I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will
be their God and they shall be my people." Then God
and Christ and immortal Saints, constitute the Temple in
this glorious City of Zion.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have been thus particular in quoting the Scriptures, in
answer to the questions proposed, to endeavor if possible to
dispel some of the thick darkness and mist of Shakerism,
Quakerism, Swedenborgianism, and all the Spiritualisms
that now seem to be settling down all over the moral world,
and shutting out even the very light from the horizon.
To my mind this spiritualizing system, when God's word
admits of a literal interpretation, and&mdash;according to rule&mdash;the
literal first; is, to use a sailor phrase, like a ship groping
her way into Boston Bay in the night, in a thick snow
with the moon at full. Nothing could be more deceptive
to the mariner; the flying clouds at one moment light up
the firmament by the thinness of its vapor, (encouraging
the mariner to believe that he shall now see the light house)
the next moment it grows darker, and so it continues to
deceive them, until of a sudden the breakers are roaring
all around them&mdash;the ship is dashed upon the rocks&mdash;one
general cry goes aloft for mercy! and all hope is forever
gone&mdash;ship and mariners strewed all over the beach!
Good God! help us to steer clear of these spiritual interpretations
of Thy word, where it is made so clear that the
second coming and kingdom of Christ will be as literal
and real, as the events that transpired at the first Advent,
now recorded in history.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the Saviour comes the second time, it will be
with the City, (the Capital of his kingdom) seated upon
his throne. Hear him: "When the son of man shall
come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then
shall he be <i>seated</i> upon the throne of his <i>glory</i>." Matt. xxv.
31. "And the city had no need of the sun&mdash;for the glory
of God did lighten it, and the lamb is the light thereof."
"But the <i>throne</i> of God and the Lamb shall <i>be in it</i>." Rev.
xxi: 23, and xxii: 3. This <i>glory</i> is none other than the
golden City. When "one like the son of man came before
the Ancient of days," in Daniel, he received "<i>Dominion</i>,
and <i>Glory</i>, and a <i>Kingdom</i>." Glory, signifies worldly
<a id='Page_23'></a>splendor, and magnificence. What, I ask, will be more
splendid and glorious than this City of Gold poised fifteen
hundred miles into the Heavens. The Psalmist cries out
in view of it, in this sublime language, "Let thy Glory be
above all the earth!" and so it will be; and as his dominion
is from sea to sea, and from the rivers unto the ends of
the earth, so I believe his <i>glory</i> will be seen from the
uttermost border. Other views of the glory of God and
Christ do not destroy this. Saint John has connected in
one, the "<i>Holy City</i>, <i>New Jerusalem</i>, <i>Tabernacle of God</i>,
<i>Bride the Lambs Wife</i>, coming down from God, <i>out of
Heaven</i> to dwell with his <i>people</i>." <span class='sc'>Proof</span>&mdash;"And God
shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall
be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall
there be any more pain." "And he that sit upon the
throne said, behold I make all things new, and he said
unto me write, for these words are true and faithful." Rev.
xxi: 4, 5. Is it not clear that the <i>City</i>, and the <i>King</i>, and
<i>Saints</i>, are here distinctly described. Why, then, all this
shouting about a figurative fulfillment, while yourselves
and the world are groping through the "<i>snow storm</i>."</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>The old Prophets looking down through the vista of
time to the coming of this heavenly city, break forth in language
like the following: "And it shall come to pass that
he that is left in <i>Zion</i> and he that remaineth in <i>Jerusalem</i>
shall be called holy, even every one that is written among
the living in <i>Jerusalem</i>." "Then the Moon shall be confounded
and the Sun ashamed when the Lord of hosts
shall reign in Mount <i>Zion</i> and in <i>Jerusalem</i>&mdash;(why? because
John says they will 'have no need of the sun nor
the moon,') and before his ancients gloriously." Who are
they? Noah, Abraham and the Prophets. Again: "Look
upon <i>Zion</i> the <i>City</i> of our solemnities; thine eye shall see
<i>Jerusalem</i> a quiet habitation, a <i>Tabernacle</i> that shall not be
taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be
removed." "Break forth into joy, sing together ye waste
places of <i>Jerusalem</i> for the Lord hath comforted his people,
he hath redeemed <i>Jerusalem</i>." "Give no rest till he establish
and till he make <i>Jerusalem</i> a praise in the earth."
Do they mean old Jerusalem? The Saviour's prediction
is against it, "left desolate," its inhabitants "carried away
<a id='Page_24'></a>captive and trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times
of the Gentiles be fulfilled." Luke xxi. Further: "But
be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create, behold
I create <i>Jerusalem</i> a rejoicing and her people a joy,
and I will rejoice in <i>Jerusalem</i> and joy in my people, and
the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor
the voice of crying." Isa. iv: 3; xxiv: 23; xxxiii: 20; lii: 9;
lxii: 7; lxv: 18, 19. Also read xl: 1; lii: 1; lx: 14, and
xxxv: 10. "At that time they shall call <i>Jerusalem</i> the
<i>throne</i> of the Lord, and all the nations shall be gathered
into it&mdash;neither shall they walk any more after the imagination
of their evil heart." "In those days shall Juda be
saved and <i>Jerusalem</i> shall dwell <i>safely</i> and this is the name
wherewith she shall be called, <span class='sc'>The Lord our Righteousness</span>.
For thus saith the Lord, David shall never want a
man to set upon the throne of the house of Israel." Jer.
iii: 17; xxxiii: 16, 17. "The Lord also shall roar out of
<i>Zion</i> and utter his voice from <i>Jerusalem</i>, then shall <i>Jerusalem
be holy</i>, and there shall be no stranger pass through
her any more." Joel iii: 16, 17.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here then, in every instance save one or two, the people
of God are connected with the "<i>Zion</i> of God," "<i>City</i>
of God," "<i>Jerusalem</i> which is to be in the last days." The
Psalmist says, "Glorious things are spoken of thee, O <i>City</i>
of God." lxxxvii: 3. John's record is, "Him that overcometh
will I make a pillar in the Temple of my God, and
he shall go no more out, and I will write upon him the
name of my God and the name of the City of my God,
(what union, and yet, how distinct!) which is new <i>Jerusalem</i>
<a id='Page_25'></a>which cometh down <i>out</i> of heaven from my God,
and I will write upon him my new name." How could
the Saviour have been more explicit and plain. "Him that
overcometh." Who? Why, the Saint; not the City, the
<i>new Jerusalem</i>. Again: "Blessed are they that do his
commandments that they may have right to the tree of life,
and may enter in through the gates into the city." If the
city is the Saints, what is this that enters into and have
right to the tree of life? Can the <i>City</i> go into the <i>City</i>?
If so, then we acknowledge the <i>City</i> is the Saints. But it
reads, the Saints go in there.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Rev. xxi: 16, the City is said to be four square, twelve
thousand furlongs; the length, and the breadth, and the
height of it are equal. Then, according to arithmetical
computation, it is fifteen hundred miles square. Now, if
the City spiritually means the Saints of God, then, to carry
out the figure, the Saints must stand over, or upon each
other (according to the common stature) one million and
four hundred thousand deep; or will it be asserted that
they are fifteen hundred miles tall!</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>SANCTUARY.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Well, says one, are you going to call this <i>City</i> the Sanctuary
too? If you will allow the Bible testimony you will
have to believe it is, or search more diligently for it in this
planet than any one else ever has that I have heard of.
But it has been proved by most able men, and learned men,
that it is the Earth, or the Land of Canaan. Well, let us
look at it again. But allow me first to recommend to
your particular notice, O. R. L. Grosier's article in the
Day Star Extra, for the 7th of February, 1846, from the
37th to the 44th page. Read it again. In my humble
opinion it is superior to any thing of the kind extant.</p>

<p class='c005'>"<i>Sanctuary</i> was the first name the Lord gave the Tabernacle,
which name covers not only the Tabernacle with
<a id='Page_26'></a>the two apartments, but also the court with all its hangings,
and all the vessels of the ministry." Exo. xxv: 8, 9, and
38, 21; Num. i: 53. This, then, was a dwelling place,
and a true pattern of the heavenly, embracing within its
"jaspar" walls "the Paradise of God," with the "pure
river of the water of life," and the "tree of life," and the
"Golden City in the midst," all to come down from heaven
and be located in old Jerusalem. Za. 14th chapter. That's
too absurd to believe, says one. Is it any more so, than to
believe the Apostle John's testimony? Does he not show
us that the tree of life is inside of the gates, in xxii: 14.
Read also the two first verses. Do not the waters issue
out from the throne? and is not the tree of life on either
side of it? and is not the promise&mdash;to him that overcometh
I will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of
the Paradise of God? Well, continues the objector, I don't
know but that I could have believed your Scripture testimony
concerning the city, but I can't believe that God has
such a place in the third heavens, and that it will descend
to this earth with a river of water in, or on it. How can
you believe then, what you are experiencing every day of
your life, on the planet in which we live? While she is
flying in her orbit around the Sun at the rate of fifty-eight
thousand miles per hour, she is at the same time whirling
over like a ball from East to West, at the rate of six hundred
miles per hour, in her diurnal or daily motion, bottom
upwards, as it would appear, every twenty-four hours, and
yet, by an unseen power, (readily accounted for by Astronomers,)
not only the rivers and the lakes, but the
mighty ocean, remains unmoved.</p>

<p class='c005'>As we have before quoted, Moses says that a river went
out of Eden to water the Garden, and became into four
heads. Gen. ii: 10, 14. Now let us turn to Ezekiel's
prophecy for a corresponding view, as "in the mouth of two
or three witnesses, shall every word be established." In
chapter 43, 1st and 7th verses, he testifies that this accords
with the vision he had by the river Chebar twenty years
before, (previously quoted.) Here he sees the Glory of
God on the east side of the <i>Sanctuary</i>, (where Moses said
the flaming sword and Cherubims were,) and his "voice
like the noise of many waters saying to him that the house
of Israel shall no more defile God's name." Afterwards,
in 47th chapter, 1st and 5th verse: "He brought me again
unto the door of the house, and behold waters issued out
<a id='Page_27'></a>from under the threshold of the house eastward&mdash;(observe
how particular to mention the "east side")&mdash;for the fore
front of the house stood towards the east, and the waters
came down from <i>under</i>, from the right side of the house."
His guide then measured the waters one thousand cubits
(more than one-fourth of a mile) "the waters were to the
ankles," but when he had measured four thousand cubits,
they had become waters to swim in, that could not be passed
over. In 12th verse he describes the tree of life yielding
its monthly fruit, for meat, and its unfading leaves for
medicine. Why all this? "Because the waters issued
out of the Sanctuary." Now read again in Rev. xxii: 1, 2;
does not John tell the same story: the waters issuing from
out the throne, the tree of life, the monthly fruit, the leaves
for healing, the nations. Is not this after the city comes
down? In 48th chapter, 8th verse: "And the sanctuary
shall be in the midst of it." Once more the measuring
rod is run over it, showing the four sides just like the old
pattern in the wilderness, and then says the Sanctuary shall
be in the midst thereof. From 30th to 35th verse, he describes
the wall and the gates as John does in Rev. xxi: 13,
and closes up his prophecy in these words, "And the name
of the city from that day shall be, the Lord is there." Now
let the old prophet Isaiah testify to what he saw: "Look
upon <i>Zion</i> the <i>City</i> of our solemnities, thine eyes shall see
Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a Tabernacle that shall not
be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be
removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of
<i>broad rivers and streams</i>, wherein shall go no galley with
oars, neither shall gallant ships pass thereby." xxxiii: 20, 21.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Psalmist says, "there <i>is</i> a river; the streams whereof
make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacle
of the Most High. God is in the midst of her"&mdash;46:
4, 5. Jeremiah says, "A glorious high throne from the
beginning is the place of our <i>sanctuary</i>." xvii: 12. The
Psalmist replies, "For he hath looked down from the
height of his <i>sanctuary</i>; from heaven did the Lord behold
the earth." cii: 19. (If he had said <i>sanctuary</i> instead
of earth, we should not have been easily moved from
our former exposition.) "The Lord is in his holy temple,
the Lord's throne is in heaven." xi: 4. Paul says to the
Hebrews, "We have such an high priest, who is set on
the right hand of the throne of the majesty, in the heavens;
<a id='Page_28'></a>a minister of the <i>sanctuary</i> and of the <i>true</i> Tabernacle,
which the Lord pitched, and not man." Heb. viii: 1, 2.
"For the <i>invisible things</i> of Him from the creation of the
world are <i>clearly</i> seen, being understood by the <i>things that
are made</i>." Rom. i: 20. Paul tells the Hebrews how
they may understand these <i>invisible</i> things, which he says
are <i>clearly seen</i>. See viii. c., 5 v. "Shadow of heavenly
things." For see, (saith he) "that thou make all things according
to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount."
Now then, whenever we want to understand about the
heavenly <i>sanctuary</i>, we must turn to Moses's description
of the sanctuary in the wilderness, which he made after the
pattern God gave him; which Paul says were shadows of
heavenly things. How will a man dare (in the face of all
this inspired testimony) to stand here on God's earth, and
assert that the heavenly sanctuary with all that pertains to
it is a <span class='fss'>FIGURE</span>, and spiritualize it away. It would be ten
thousand times easier for him to spiritualize the old Tabernacle
and Solomon's Temple, seeing the one that is to
come as far exceeds the temple of Solomon or Nehemiah,
(although, it is allowed, that nothing on earth ever exceeded
them) as the most splendid palace of the king does the
sentry box of his guard. Much safer would it be for him
to teach that the rocks had never been rent, or as he passed
the streets in the afternoon and saw the shadow of the
buildings, should insist upon it that the shadows were real,
but the buildings, which cast the shadows, were spiritual.
Such doctrine should be ranked with Mahometanism and
Jesuitism, save their demoniac spirit; it comes from the
"bottomless pit and will go into perdition: and they that
dwell on the earth will wonder." Rev. xvii: 8. But I
wish to present further evidence of the real (not spiritual)
coming of this heavenly <i>sanctuary</i>. Ezekiel says in his
37th chapter, where God has promised his spirit and life to
the whole house of Israel, "Moreover, I will make a covenant
of peace with them; it shall be an <i>everlasting</i> covenant
with them, and I will place them and multiply them,
and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore;
my <i>tabernacle</i> also shall be with them: aye, I will
be their God, and they shall be my people. And the
heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when
my <i>sanctuary</i> shall be in the midst of them forevermore."
26-28 v. Now here is God's sacred promise that his
sanctuary shall be in the midst of his <i>people</i>; and I have
<a id='Page_29'></a>already quoted his 48th chap. 10 v. where he says when
the angel had "measured the land twenty-five thousand
reeds in length and ten thousand in breadth," said, "and
the <i>sanctuary</i> of the Lord shall be in the midst thereof."
Now will it be insisted upon that the land, or his people,
is the sanctuary; rather let us submit to the Scripture testimony.
On the last night of our Saviour's ministry here
on earth, in company with his disciples, when everything
else had failed to arouse them, he to quicken their drooping
spirits says, "Let not your hearts be troubled: ye believe
in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are
many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you;
and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again
and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye
may be also." John xiv: 1, 3. I think I have now proved
by unquestionable authority, that this heavenly <i>sanctuary</i>
is the very place with <i>mansions</i> which he has been preparing,
and according to his promise is now coming to receive
his saints. But may there not after all be a failure
here. "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word
shall not pass away." Having such testimony as this, we
rejoice in "hope of the glory that is to be revealed."</p>

<p class='c005'>"Unto two thousand three hundred days then shall the
sanctuary be cleansed." Dan. viii: 14.</p>

<p class='c005'>This, then, I understand, is the selfsame "<i>heavenly Sanctuary</i>,
the <i>New Jerusalem</i>, the <i>Paradise of God</i>." Well,
says the reader, this cannot be; how can Paradise, which
Paul said was in the "third heavens," and where you say
Jesus our High Priest is, be defiled? Where was the first
sin that ever cursed this world committed? O, say you,
that was six thousand years ago. Admit that it was, has
God ever pardoned that sin? Turn to Gen. iii: 17, 19.
The ground is still cursed, and man gets his living by the
sweat of his brow. Why? Because the extent of this
great sin could never be known, until God had put the last
seal upon his saints, "and the dead be judged." But say
you, the curse was upon the earth and its inhabitants.
Yes; but was not Paradise polluted by this sin? But how
can it be that anything in heaven is polluted, or unclean?
Have I not proved by the astronomer's conclusive arguments,
that this earthly ball which we inhabit is continually
flying through the regions of unlimited space, in the same
direction with all other planets, seen or known in the solar
system? Think you that this little speck of earth is the
<a id='Page_30'></a>only thing that is defiled, among the millions and myriads
of worlds which stud the diadem of space? We are told
that the "stars are not pure in his sight." "Yea, the heavens
are not clean in his sight." Job xv: 15; xxv: 5.
Was not the sanctuary on earth which the high priest
cleansed the tenth day of the seventh month every year, a
pattern of the true? Does not Paul tell us that Jesus our
high priest has entered into the true <i>sanctuary</i>, into heaven
itself. See Heb. ix: 12, 24; and viii: 1, 2. Then is
not our high priest in the proper place to "cleanse the
sanctuary?" I cannot for the life of me see, how the pattern
or type can be made to appear in any other way.
How then can the earth (as one in the voice of truth, and
many other writers say) be the <i>sanctuary</i>; while spiritualizers
are saying it is the saints. O Lord give us the
truth!</p>

<p class='c005'>The strongest proof ever been adduced to prove that the
earth or Canaan was the <i>sanctuary</i>, is found in Exodus xv:
17. Now what place is this which the Lord has made to
dwell in? The answer is, "in the sanctuary O Lord,
which thy hands have established." Paul says this sanctuary
is in the heavens which the Lord pitched and not man.
Heb. viii: 1, 2. The only other passage for proof of the
land is Psalms lxxviii: 54, both of which go to strengthen
the testimony before adduced. "And he brought them to
the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain which
his right hand had purchased." Does he in either text say
that the mountain is the sanctuary? If I can understand
him, he says that the mountain is the <i>border</i> of his sanctuary;
just as Ezekiel has shown where his guide measured
the land, and then said that the sanctuary of the Lord
should be in the midst of it. Now the word <i>sanctuary</i> is
mentioned more than seventy times in the bible, and the
whole of them,&mdash;with but a few exceptions, represent it a
dwelling place, a building. The Psalmist says, that the
"Lord looked down from his sanctuary from heaven to the
earth." Not to his sanctuary. But let us see what Daniel
and the angel Gabriel called a sanctuary. Dan. viii:
10-12. Is it not plain here that Popery took away the
daily (i. e. destroyed Paganism) by arms or armies that
stood on his (Popery's part, or side)&mdash;xi: 31. The taking
away his sanctuary or polluting it is the same; for it would
be absurd to say that the <i>land</i> was taken away, (11 v.) or
that by this transaction the land was <i>now</i> polluted&mdash;xi: 31.
<a id='Page_31'></a>Now read ix: 17, 19. Is not Daniel praying for the restoration
of old Jerusalem, the city and <i>sanctuary</i> (the
temple where God's people worshipped) which had been
desolated, <i>burnt up</i>, by the king of Babylon's army, about
seventy years before? (see Jer. lii: 12, 14) and remained
a burnt district until the commandment by Cyrus to Ezra,
and afterwards to Nehemiah, to build the temple and city.
Now in answer to this prayer, God immediately despatched
the angel Gabriel from the court of heaven, to give Daniel
"skill and understanding"&mdash;22d v. In the 26th verse
he informs him that Messiah shall be cut off, (crucify the
Saviour) and the people of the prince that shall come,
shall destroy the city and the <i>sanctuary</i>. How was this
accomplished? Josephus who was an eye witness and
historian, informs us that Titus the son of Vespasian, the
Emperor of Rome, about A. D. 70, (five hundred and sixty
years after the temple and city had been rebuilt by Nehemiah)
came with his mighty Roman army and took
Jerusalem, and burned up the city and temple (the sanctuary)
and it was soon after "ploughed as a field," (Micah
iii: 12) "and not one stone left upon another." This,
then, was the very circumstance, Prince, and people, alluded
to by the angel Gabriel. I believe no one undertakes
to dispute this point.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now we learn from this, that the angel Gabriel's instructions
from heaven in answer to Daniel's prayer was, that
it was the <i>Temple in the city of old Jerusalem</i>, which is the
pattern or figure, or as Paul says "answereth to the new,
which is above, which is the mother of us all." Can anything
be more plain and explicit than that this is the sanctuary
to be cleansed, "unto two thousand three hundred
days."</p>

<p class='c005'>In the 11th verse he says, "the daily was taken away,
(that is, Paganism) and the place of his <i>sanctuary</i> cast
down." How plain it is that this wicked sanctuary (where
idols and devils were worshipped) was a building, cast
down. How could they cast down the earth to the earth?
(12th v.) and it (this same Popery) cast down the truth to
the ground, so the ground was not destroyed; clear proof
it was not the sanctuary. Well, but we don't believe that
God will ever cleanse the wicked sanctuary of Paganism.</p>

<p class='c005'>The sanctuary must be cleansed, (made holy) so must
the saints; for St. John says, "nothing unclean or unholy
shall enter there." Then before the saints can enter the
<a id='Page_32'></a>sanctuary it will be cleansed, not by fire, but by blood,
(please follow the pattern.) Now will it still be said that
the earth is the sanctuary? Can any proof be adduced
that the earth is to be burned even, until after immortality
is given to the saints? Just look at Zach. xiv. chapter;
here he shows us that the wicked shall be punished after
"<i>Jerusalem</i> (the sanctuary) shall be safely inhabited," (11th
and 12th verses and onward;) and before this, in the 8th
to 11th verse, he has shown us that the land shall be turned
into a plain; the 8th and 9th verses shows who does it, and
how it is accomplished; and then of the sanctuary, Jerusalem,
as though it was understood that this was done for the
express purpose of making a foundation for the building.
Here I think any one may see, that the border of this heavenly
<i>sanctuary</i> will extend to the "mountain of his inheritance,"
(Exo. xv: 17; Psl. lxxviii: 54) and this plain for
the location and walls of the sanctuary will be made clean
and pure. This is all the cleansing the earth will receive,
until after "the great battle of God Almighty." So then,
if the earth is the <i>sanctuary</i>, God's people need have no
trouble here about its being cleansed, for they will have
that work to do in immortality; but we believe that work
is now being accomplished. Again, "how long shall the
sanctuary and the host be trodden under foot." Jesus
said that old "Jerusalem should be trodden down of the
Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles should be fulfilled."
But how ridiculous to believe that the heavenly sanctuary
is "trodden under foot." Is it any more so than to believe
what St. Paul tells us, concerning the High Priest of
these "heavenly places" in the heavens. See Heb. x: 29.
"Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye, shall he be
thought worthy who hath <i>trodden under foot the Son of
God</i>, and counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he
was sanctified, an unholy thing." So we can see according
to Paul's exposition, if they have trodden the master
under foot, how much more the building and the household,
("the sanctuary and host.") In the preceding verses
it is explained; just read 10th, 11th and 12th verses;
the papal power of Rome, the abomination which maketh
desolate, casting down some of the host and stars to the
ground and stamping upon them; also casting down the
sanctuary and the truth to the ground, by satanic influence&mdash;this
is treading down, connected with which is all other
ungodly antichristian influences operating against it, which
<a id='Page_33'></a>is to be purged out: even as the high priest here on earth
cleansed the pattern once a year, which was never <i>literally</i>
trodden down by any one but himself while in the act of
cleansing it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The angel did not answer the question concerning the
host in the 13th verse, but Gabriel at his second visit showed
Daniel that seventy weeks were determined upon his people,
leaving 1810 years more to be explained at his third
and last visit to him. See x: 14; "Now I am come (for
what?) to make thee understand what shall befall thy people
in the latter days." Please read on to the end of the
twelfth chapter and see how faithfully he has described the
host (the holy people) and one clothed in linen, (the Lord
Jesus; see x: 21,) from above the waters of the river with
his hands upraised to heaven, swearing by him that liveth
forever that all these wonders, (including the resurrection
in 2d verse) shall be finished when he, (meaning the antichristian
powers which are led on and urged forward by
the "prince of the power of the air,") shall have accomplished
to scatter the power of the holy people, by the process
of purifying, being made white, and tried, and if they
pass through and withstand all this fiery ordeal and come
to the 1335 days, they shall be blessed, and then be delivered
out of such a time of trouble as never was since there
was a nation. Thus, I think, the angel has described the
treading down the host, and it appears to me that all this
severe discipline is to prepare them to enter the holy city,
for an angel crying with a mighty voice has shown them
that they have been in company with devils, foul spirits,
and every unclean and hateful bird; and another voice
says, come out of her my people, for <i>all nations</i> have drank
of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. Rev. xviii: 2,
4. And the poison has operated to such an alarming extent
that it has baffled the skill of all the Doctors of Divinity
in the universe, and in spite of all their preaching, fasting
and praying, with the assistance of the principals of the
flock, the famine prophecied of by Amos the Prophet, has
come upon them. How awfully be describes it: "Wandering
from sea to sea, and from the north to the east,
running to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall
not find it." God never called his people out from any
other place than the churches; if the whole truth, the meat
in due season had been given and received there, and
Babylon's poisonous cup rejected, then there would have
<a id='Page_34'></a>been no severity in the discipline of its members. The
handling of God's word deceitfully, (for it would not be
admitted to say of learned men, ignorantly,) has led the
professed world into this labyrinth; and men are now being
ridiculed and laughed at, not only because they believe
and are looking for the Lord himself to descend from heaven
because they are now sending forth their epistles to
(as they think) enlighten their brethren and friends concerning
the coming of Christ in the "clouds of heaven,"
by subscribing themselves "yours, no longer gazing up
into heaven;" "yours, in the clouds of heaven&mdash;meeting
the Lord in the air;" while another one in the Shaker's
camp in N. H., is shouting and rejoicing that he has found
the Mount <i>Zion</i>, (meaning, of course, the holy city) and
that the Germans from Europe are gathering to it; while
another, from another quarter, (as I understand standing
on the "broad platform") has attempted to prove that the
powers of the heavens have been shaken, and the sign of
the Son of man in heaven has been seen; and another
one saying that "God is as much in one place as another!"
while another is shouting Hallelujah, because he believes
it to be so clear that the "saints are the <i>holy city</i>;" and yet
another subscribes himself "yours, in the kingdom." O,
says one, how alarming these things are! they look just
like the "<i>perilous times</i>" St. Paul described to Timothy
for the "last days." 2 Tim. iii: 4, 5. Jesus also, in
Matt, xxiv: 24. I wish the good ministers would teach
them sound doctrine; the great trouble would be to ascertain
in what denomination to find them, for I have lying
before me the creed of a professed Orthodox church o
1844, (<i>right opinion, true belief</i>) of this enlightened place,
signed by its two ministers and one hundred and forty-seven
members, (one of them a minister in New-Bedford
with a similar flock) who say in their fifth article, "I believe
that Christ came to establish the kingdom of heaven
on earth, <i>which</i> is the visible church." Now all the proof
they offer from, the Scriptures is what follows: "And I
say unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will
build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it." "And he shall reign over the house of Jacob
forever; and, of his, kingdom there shall be no end."
Matt. xvi: 18; Luke i: 33. Now if there is one particle
of proof from these two passages, that Christ has established
his kingdom here, and that kingdom is the church, then I
<a id='Page_35'></a>confess I do not understand English. In the second article
the only proof adduced for "and Almighty Saviour"
is Hebrews xvii: 25. Their doors are wide open for
members, but they must assent to this creed. Why continue
to pray "<span class='fss'>THY KINGDOM COME</span>?" I wish to be distinctly
understood, that I do not mean anything invidious.
I am only stating the truth in behalf of "God's word;" for
I believe that all the nominal churches in this place, (and
they all profess to be right) are holding the same or similar
unscriptural errors that has led the world around them
astray, not because they are more ignorant than in other
places, for I believe for general intelligence they will compare
with any place of its numbers on the habitable globe.
The ministers too, with one exception, I believe, are all
college bred. And this creed, be it remembered, is the
most modern and modest of any in the place, for I believe
it is the fashion now when the church is remoddled to remoddle
the creed also, no matter how <i>orthodox</i> it was
before, there are various ways to understand the scriptures,
but when once the creed is published, all the members, old
and young, must assent to the truth of it as their standard,
until some one, more skilled in this business, proposes an
alteration. What a burlesque on the never changing truth
of the great eternal! Why follow in the footsteps of
Popery to trammel the mind? Why not as well require
a rule to get money? Then if <i>we</i> are destitute of the true
light from the word of God in this enlightened place, where
in the name of the Lord, in any other village or city, can it
be found? God has said that "light is sown for the righteous,"
and "unto the upright there ariseth light in the
darkness." Psalms. But I must pass on&mdash;I have dwelt
much longer on this lamentable picture than I intended,
and yet I have hardly begun.</p>

<p class='c005'>I wish here to ask a few questions on one of the greatest
errors that the world ever embraced, first established by
Pope Gregory, A. D. 603. I mean the changing of God's
seventh day, Sabbath, (for it is sheer sophistry to call it the
Jews Sabbath, as Jesus our divine Lord says "it was made
for man,") to the first day of the week.</p>

<p class='c005'>Paul says, "there therefore remaineth a keeping of the
Sabbath to the people of God." Isaiah shows us that in
the New Heavens and Earth all flesh shall keep the "Sabbath."
Does any bible reader believe that this will be on
any other day than what God has ordained. Let us look
<a id='Page_36'></a>at the patterns and shadows of the true. Heb. viii: 5;
ix. and x: 1. Is not the true in the eternal state? Think
you that God will ever change the true to answer the pattern
of Popery, that has been foremost in desolating the
world? Every candid mind says no! What should we
do then? God will tell us. "Six days shalt thou labor
and do all thy work, but the <span class='fss'>SEVENTH IS THE SABBATH</span> of
the Lord thy God; (perhaps the minister will tell you he
meant the Jewish Sabbath&mdash;don't you believe him nor any
one else; they can't prove it by the Bible) in it thou shalt
not do any work;" "wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath
day and hallowed it." Exod. xx. Why all this costly
array in "building the Tabernacle and afterwards the
Temple?" <i>Answer</i>, it was to put the Ark in. 2 Sam. 2-7.
Hear David 1 Chron. xvii: 2, 12. What was the
Ark? A small chest in which was a precious relic; the
commandments of God; his testimony to man; (see Exod.
xxv: 10, 12) how it is guarded night and day by Cherubims.
What are these commandments to us? They that
keep them shall "enter in through the gates into the city."
Rev. xxii: 14. Will you say then that the fourth commandment
is abolished? If so, please cite us to the chapter
and verse. I say it cannot be found within the lids of
the bible. Will you reply by saying that the first day is
the Sabbath, or that it was ever kept by Jesus or his apostles
as a day set apart for religious worship; if so, where
is the text? I challenge the world to produce it! If it
cannot be found, why violate still this sacred command of
God and reject all the light that is thrown in your pathway?
God will have some to keep his commandments, if
it be but "one of a city and two of a family." Jer. Some
endeavor to clear their conscience by saying there is no
Sabbath to be kept. This, to me, looks like infidelity.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have stated that one writer had asserted that the powers
of Heaven had been shaken and the sign of the Son
of man been seen. His argument on the twenty-fourth of
Matthew, I like much, until he begins to prove what none
of us have yet seen or heard. If so, why continue to say
that "men's hearts fail them for fear and for looking after
the things that are coming on the earth." Jesus does not
say that they will be looking for <i>him</i>, but then they shall
see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, when
they have seen the preceding signs. What arguments are
there yet to be presented that will so alarm the Laodicean
<a id='Page_37'></a>church, and scoffer, to fulfil. Isa. lx: 14, and Rev. iii: 9.
It appears to me that nothing short of the voice of God
will do this. Then, I think, the wise will understand, and
get their blessing, as in Dan. xii: 12; then will they return
and discern between the righteous and the wicked;
then will they be found with the world, in the time of Daniel's
trouble; they will then have passed through the "fiery
trial" and the Sealing Angel have done his last work.
This, as it looks to me will be the time when God will
roar out of Zion and utter his voice from Jerusalem&mdash;and
the heavens and the earth will shake; then shall Jerusalem
be holy. Joel iii: 16, 17. It will then be cleansed from
every impurity. This, I think, will be the shaking of the
powers of heaven, for then will God's people <i>know</i> that he
dwells in Zion, (17th verse) not in the Shaker's camp, but
in his Heavenly Sanctuary, and <i>then</i> shall appear the
"Sign of the Son of Man in Heaven," the "Holy Jerusalem
descending out of Heaven from God, having the
glory of God; And her light was like unto a stone most
precious, even like a jaspar stone clear as chrystal." I
have not the least particle of doubt but that it will be seen
just as he has described it. The glory and effulgence of
that sight will so light up the heavens in its majestic course
down from the parted skies, that we shall have no further
need of the telescope; but in the language of our adorable
coming Lord, exclaim "I see heaven <i>open</i> and the
Angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of
Man"! This, I think, will be the Sign of the Son of Man
in Heaven. A telescopic view of the burning bright star
Sirius, on the southeast of the belt of Orion, in the southwestern
heavens, early in the evening, will give a faint
view of the above description.</p>

<p class='c005'>St. John saw this City suspended in the air, he therefore
had a clear view of its twelve foundations and the names
of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb, and the twelve gates,
and the names written thereon, which are the names of
the twelve tribes of the children of Israel. "And he
measured the wall a hundred and forty and four cubits,"
two hundred and sixty-two and a half feet, and they were
studded with all kinds of precious stones, and diamonds
from the bowels of the earth, while the gates are adorned
with the treasures of the ocean. Now this beautiful description
of the City is given in the twenty-first chapter,
from 16 to 18 and 21st verses. We must keep it distinct
<a id='Page_38'></a>from the walls. He says, it lieth four square, and measures
twelve thousand furlongs. This sum, divided by
eight furlongs, which make a mile, would stand thus:
8/12000&mdash;fifteen hundred miles square or seven millions
nine hundred and twenty thousand feet on six sides (it being
a cubical form.) When we look at the size of this <i>City</i>
of Gold, we are at once almost overwhelmed with the
view of its dimensions. Fifteen hundred miles high, long
and wide! In the seventeenth verse, he gives but one
way to measure the wall, and that is its height. If he had
undertaken to have given the contents of the City by the
same rule, he would have measured the wall.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then we have nothing more to do in making an arithmetical
calculation, but follow the Apostle's description.
Jesus said, in my Father's house are many mansions.
Now, allowing twelve feet between joints for a story, this
seven millions nine hundred and twenty thousand feet
square would give six hundred and sixty thousand stories,
twelve feet high, (Ezekiel xl: 7,) and fifteen hundred miles
square, four hundred and forty stories to a mile: which
would amount to 990,000,000, nine hundred and ninety
millions of square miles on a level surface, twelve feet
high&mdash;equal to the square miles contained in five worlds
like this, (which is only one hundred and ninety-nine millions
five hundred and twelve thousand square miles,) and
seventy times more extensive than the Continent of America.
Now six hundred and sixty thousand twelve foot
rooms in each story, would make in all 435,600,000,000&mdash;four
hundred and thirty-five thousand and six hundred
millions of twelve feet square "rooms,"&mdash;<i>Ezekiel</i>; "places,"&mdash;<i>John</i>;
or "mansions,"&mdash;<i>Jesus</i>. It is computed that
there are 900,000,000&mdash;nine hundred millions of inhabitants
now on the Earth. The Bible informs us that there
was but one, six thousand years ago. Admit that there
was nine hundred millions at the commencement of creation,
and this number had passed away every thirty years
for two hundred generations, their whole number would
only amount to 180,000,000,000&mdash;one hundred and eighty
thousand millions, a little more than one-third of the mansions
in this building; four hundred and eighty-four to
every human being now on the earth. Surely, this looks
like an "abundant entrance" into the everlasting kingdom.
O yes, say many, I see there is abundance of room
for every body! The apostle tells us who they are. He
<a id='Page_39'></a>says, "There shall in no wise enter into it anything that
defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh
a lie; but they which are written in the Lamb's book
of life." This then is the capacious and glorious "golden
<i>City</i>;" the "New Jerusalem;" the "heavenly Sanctuary;"
the "Bride the Lamb's Wife;" the "Mother of us all;"
the "Paradise of God;" the capital of our coming Lord's
<span class='fss'>EVERLASTING</span> kingdom, which is now about to descend
from the "third heaven" by the way of the open door,
down by the "flaming sword" of Orion. O let us see to
it, that we are all ready to enter into this celestial City.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
